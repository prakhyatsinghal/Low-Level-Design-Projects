Right Way to Approach Problem

1. Two reasons due to which we face difficulties while designing a System or Low Level Design are

We are not sure what to Make : We must have clarity about the system that we are going to build. We should keep User Requirements very clear before starting working out on the Designing Part.

Unstructured Thinking : Unstructured Thinking is the biggest reason for Failures in System Design.

2. For example We want to build an Ecommerce Website and before building out the proper skeleton , we implement the Products Class and Cart Class. Now when we want to connect / merge these classes using the Bottom - Up approach then there are high chances that we will face difficulties and irregularity in our modules.

3. Never Use Bottom-up approach while designing the System. Always goes for the Top-Bottom thought process.

4. LLD works as an interface between GUI and Database. So Before Going for the System Design it will be better for us if we take a glimpse over the GUI and DataBase part of the system.

5. Doing this we will have good hints and ideas about the functionality of the System we are going to build.
