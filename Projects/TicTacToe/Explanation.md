In terms of SOLID principles, this implementation follows the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). Each class has a single responsibility, and the Game class depends on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations of the Board and Player classes, which allows for flexibility in choosing different implementations of those classes.

However, there are some opportunities for improvement. For example, the Board class violates the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) since adding a new feature, such as a larger board, would require modifying the existing implementation. A better approach would be to use a Strategy pattern, where the board implementation is abstracted behind an interface, and different implementations can be selected at runtime. Similarly, the Game class violates the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) since it depends on methods from the Board interface that it doesn't use. It would be better to split the Board interface into smaller interfaces that only expose the necessary methods to the Game class.

Overall, this implementation provides a good starting point for a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java, but there are opportunities for improvement and refactoring to make it more extensible and maintainable.
